      <p>Project Summary: Created a REST API for online cab booking application which can be used by customers to 
        login into their profile, update their information and book cabs, by a driver to login and update their 
        details along with their cab details and accept a ride from the customer. All this is over looked by the 
        admin who can also login and update their information as well as access the data in the application. 
        I have implemented data and user validation at every step, for every user.
